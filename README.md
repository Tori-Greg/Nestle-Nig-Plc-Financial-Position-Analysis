**The analysis of Nestle Nig Plc's statement of financial position reveals some important insights that can inform future decision-making:**
- The company's improved cash ratio of 0.54:1 in 2022 indicates that Nestle Nig plc has greater ability to cover its short-term obligations with its available cash and cash equivalents. This is a positive development, but the company may still need to consider ways to improve its cash flow management and ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations.

- The decline in asset turnover from 1.13 times in 2021 to 1.08 times in 2022 is a cause for concern, as it suggests that the company is becoming less efficient in using its assets to generate revenue. Given that the longer receivable collection period is largely responsible for this decline, Nestle Nig plc should explore ways to improve its accounts receivable management, such as offering incentives for early payment or reassessing its credit policies.

- Although Nestle Nig plc recorded a positive working capital in 2022, the report notes that this may be due to the fact that cash is tied up in inventory and receivables that have not been sold or collected. The company should consider implementing measures to reduce inventory holding periods and improve its receivables collection process. This could involve introducing better inventory management systems, negotiating more favorable payment terms with suppliers, and improving its communication with customers to ensure timely payment of invoices.

## Recommendation
**Based on these findings, it is recommended that Nestle Nig plc takes the following steps to improve its financial position:**
- Focus on improving cash flow management to ensure that the company has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations. This could involve implementing more stringent payment terms with customers and suppliers, exploring new sources of funding, and reassessing its capital expenditure plans to ensure that they are aligned with the company's overall financial objectives.
